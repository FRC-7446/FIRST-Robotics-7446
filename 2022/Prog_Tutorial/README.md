# Harry's intro to C++

## Section 1 - How does C++ work?
* Advantages vs disadvantages of C++
* How does a C++ program work?
* Using header files
* What should I comment?
* Compiling C++ code

## Section 2 - Control flow
* If/else statements
* Switch statements

## Section 3 - Using variables I
* Different variable types
* Scopes of variables (Scope I)
* Variable operations
* Casting variables
* Arrays

## Section 4 - Creating functions
* Why use functions?
* Building a function
* Naming conventions

## Section 5 - Error checking
* What causes an error?
* How to check for errors?
* How to return our own errors?

## Section 6 - Challenge I
**Create a basic unbreakable calculator**
* Takes 3 inputs, 2 for the numbers and 1 for the operation
* Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
* Won't break by dividing by zero
* **BONUS:** Allow the user to run the program more then once

_Code solution will be provided as well_

## Section 7 - Using external files
* Why spread code across multiple files?
* What you can and can't do (Scope II)
* Headers vs source files
* Making a header file

## Section 8 - Using variables II
* Creating your own variable type
* Structs vs classes
* Variable flags (Scope III)
* Referencing other variables
* How does a computer store information?
* Using variables for functions

## Section 9 - Challenge II
**Create a encryption and decryption program**
* Takes 2 inputs, 1 for the string to be encoded/decoded and 1 for the key
* Create a library for the encryption and decryption
* Cannot be easliy decoded without the key
* **BONUS:** Encrypt multiple strings with 1 key

_Code solution will be provided as well_

## Section 10 - Squeezing the most out of your device
* Limitations with not optimising your code
* Optimising resources used by your program
* Safety vs speed / ease vs complexity
* How does C++ code run?
* Cleaning up your garbage
