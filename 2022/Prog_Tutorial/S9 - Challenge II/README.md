# Challenge II
## Goal:
**Create a encryption and decryption program**

## Perimeters:
* Takes 2 inputs, 1 for the string to be encoded/decoded and 1 for the key

You can choose to have the user preselect their own key or to output one for them

* Create a library for the encryption and decryption

All the functions having to do with the process need to be in the library

* Cannot be easliy decoded without the key

Some examples of poor encryption:

```
> Please enter your string: Encryption example
> Output: "3nc2yp710n 3x4mp13"
> Your key is: 33
```

```
> Please enter your string: Encryption example
> Output: "elpmaxe noitpyrcnE"
> Your key is: 1
```

```
> Please enter your string: Encryption example
> Output: "_ncryption _xampl_"
> Your key is: E
```

## Bonus:
**Encrypt multiple strings with 1 key**
